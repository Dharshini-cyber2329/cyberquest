CyberFace: AI Biometric → 3D Gaming Avatar System

CyberFace is an AI-powered biometric authentication system built using DeepFace (FaceNet512) and Flask, designed as the foundation for a next-generation 3D gaming identity engine.

This project begins with secure face authentication and evolves into a game-ready avatar generation system powered by Three.js.

🔐 Phase 1 – Biometric Authentication

DeepFace (FaceNet512 embeddings)

RetinaFace detection

Flask backend API

Real-time face verification

Secure embedding comparison

Cyber-style interactive UI

🎮 Phase 2 – Avatar Generation (Upcoming)

After authentication, the system will:

Extract facial features

Generate a personalized digital avatar

Convert biometric data into a game-ready character

Render 3D models using Three.js

Integrate into an interactive browser-based game
