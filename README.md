# CYBERQUEST  
## 🔐 AI Biometric Authentication → 🎮 3D Avatar Gaming Engine

CyberQuest is an AI-powered biometric authentication system built using **DeepFace (FaceNet512)** and **Flask**.

This project begins as a secure face recognition system and evolves into a next-generation **3D avatar-based gaming identity platform** using **Three.js**.

# 📌 PROJECT OVERVIEW

CyberQuest transforms real-world biometric identity into a digital gaming character.

It combines:

- 🤖 Artificial Intelligence  
- 🔐 Biometric Security  
- 🌐 Web Development  
- 🎮 3D Gaming Technology  
- 🧠 Deep Learning

# PHASE 1 — AI FACE AUTHENTICATION (Completed)

###  Features Implemented

- DeepFace (FaceNet512 – 512D embeddings)
- RetinaFace / MTCNN detection
- Real-time webcam capture
- Biometric verification using deep metric learning
- Secure embedding comparison
- Flask backend API
- Cyber-style interactive UI
- Audio feedback system
- User registration & authentication flow

### How It Works

1. Capture user face via webcam  
2. Generate 512-dimensional embedding using FaceNet512  
3. Store embedding securely  
4. During login, generate new embedding  
5. Compare vector distance  
6. If match → Access Granted

# PHASE 2 — 3D AVATAR GENERATION (🚧 In Progress)

After successful authentication, the system will:

- Extract facial feature embeddings  
- Map biometric data to avatar traits  
- Generate personalized digital characters  
- Render interactive 3D avatars using Three.js  
- Integrate into a browser-based game environment  

### Goal
Turn real-world identity into a playable digital character.
