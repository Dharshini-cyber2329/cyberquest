CYBERQUEST

AI Biometric Authentication → 3D Avatar Gaming Engine
CyberQuest is an AI-powered biometric authentication system built using DeepFace (FaceNet512) and Flask.
This project begins as a secure face recognition system and evolves into a next-generation 3D avatar-based gaming identity platform using Three.js.

Phase 1 – AI Face Authentication (Completed)

CyberQuest currently supports:

DeepFace (FaceNet512 embeddings)
RetinaFace / MTCNN detection
Real-time webcam capture
Biometric verification using deep learning
Secure embedding comparison
Flask backend API
Cyber-style interactive UI
Audio feedback system
User registration & authentication flow

The system converts a human face into a 512-dimensional embedding vector and verifies identity using deep metric learning.

Phase 2 – 3D Avatar Generation (In Progress)

After successful authentication, the system will:

Extract facial feature embeddings
Map biometric data to avatar traits
Generate personalized digital characters
Render interactive 3D avatars using Three.js
Integrate into a browser-based game environment

Goal:
Turn real-world identity into a playable digital character.
